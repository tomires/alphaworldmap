AlphaWorldMap is a standalone map application for [Activeworlds](https://www.activeworlds.com/)'s AlphaWorld. It synchronizes with an active instance of AW client in order to visualize the user's current position and allows you to record a path for future reference. The two applications can run side-by-side, compact mode is also available. Map renders are courtesy of [AlphaMapper](http://www.imabot.com/alphamapper/).
